### Pre-Sprint (28/04/2020)
We had the chance to look at the project brief 24 hours before our first meeting with our client for the first official standup and scrum. During this time we spoke in deep about the requirements of the project, as well as who would be responsible for deliverables, repositorys and the roles within our team. 

#### Roles and Responsibilities
As for a Scrum master, **David Hulsman** was nominated due to his healthy relationship with the other members of the team, as well as the fact he was already in contact with the client regarding light details about the project. With this role, we also opted to use his github account to create and host the repository for the project. Outside of this, **Bailey Elson** nominated himself to host the AWS Services and create the IAM roles for his account. It was his responsibility to create all of the roles and permissions for everyone based of who we decide is doing what.

#### Working Philosophy
Before we assigned tasks to people, we discussed the weak and strong areas of everyones previous projects, as well as the areas in which everyone wanted to work on. We found out that whilst everyone had strong areas, no one had major weaknesses which created the first problem. To counter this, we decided to work on tasks in **groups of two, with one shadowing another**. With this solution, not only could we give 2 unique perspectives on a task but it also allowed crutial information to be easily crossed over into other tasks that one of the two were working on after. We understood the negatives of this philosophy, with us only limited to a short time to complete the project, however we believe it would keep everyone happy and focused working in pairs.
